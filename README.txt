To run plot_generator, run python3 main.py

The long term goal is to have the generator create a large set of characters who...

...have a relationship status (either negative or positive) with some other characters
...can act against other characters
...can help other characters
...have traits like "attractive", "helpful" or "vengeful" that influence how they act, how they react, and how others act toward them

The characters and their interactions will be added to the Ymir database

prot_generator will simulate some time passing and all characters in the system will make choices which will effect their state and the state of other characters. Their set of interactions will constitute a plot which can be expanded upon by a GM and used for world building.
